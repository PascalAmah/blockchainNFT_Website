        <h4>About NFTs</h4>
        <p>
          NFTs are individual tokens with valuable information stored in them.
          Because they hold a value primarily set by the market and demand, they
          can be bought and sold just like other physical types of art. NFTs'
          unique data makes it easy to verify and validate their ownership and
          the transfer of tokens between owners. What You Need to Know. NFTs are
          unique cryptographic tokens that exist on a blockchain and cannot be
          replicated. NFTs can represent real-world items like artwork and real
          estate. "Tokenizing" these real-world tangible assets makes buying,
          selling, and trading them more efficient while reducing the
          probability of fraud.
